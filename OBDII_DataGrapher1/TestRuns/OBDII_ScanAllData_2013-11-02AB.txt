A: Engine Cold.
   Started Engine ~5 sec after start record
   (only 1 frame before ???)
   Idle was mildly rough (not so bad as yesterday).
   Oil light was off.

B: Engine more or less cold (ran for < 1 min on Test A)
   Started Engine ~15 sec -- 4 or 5 frames.
   Mildly rough idle (same as Test A, not so bad as yesterday).
   Oil light was off.
